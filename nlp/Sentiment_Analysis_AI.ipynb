film were great it was just brilliant so much that i bought the film as soon as it was released for  and would recommend it to everyone to watch and the fly fishing was amazing really cried at the end it was so sad and you know what they say if you cry at a film it must have been good and this definitely was also  to the two little boy's that played the  of norman and paul they were just brilliant children are often left out of the  list i think because the stars that play them all grown up are such a big profile for the whole film but these children are amazing and should be praised for what they have done don't you think the whole story was so lovely because it was true and was someone's life after all that was shared with us all\n"]}],"source":["# Read the content of one of the
