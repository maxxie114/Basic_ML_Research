    "content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to solve LeetCode problem 200, which is about finding the number of islands. Let's see what the problem says.\n\nSo, the task is given a grid of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and consists of connected land cells. Cells are connected if they are adjacent horizontally or vertically—so diagonals don't count.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to approach this problem. It seems like a classic graph traversal problem where each island can be thought of as a connected component in an undirected graph. So, maybe using Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) would work here.\n\nLet me outline the steps I need to take:\n\n1. Iterate through each cell in the grid.\n2. When I find a '1' that hasn't been visited yet, it's the start of a new island. So I should increment my count.\n3. Then, mark all connected '1's as visited so they aren't counted again.\n\nI think using DFS is straightforward here. For each cell that's part of an island, I can recursively visit its neighboring cells (up, down, left, right) and mark them as part of the same island by changing their value to avoid revisiting.\n\nWait, but modifying the input grid might not be allowed in some cases. Oh, but LeetCode allows it since they usually don't mind if we modify the input for efficiency.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\n- Loop through each cell (i,j) in the grid.\n- If grid[i][j] is '1', then:\n   - Increment the island count by 1.\n   - Perform DFS starting at (i,j), marking all connected '1's as visited, perhaps changing them to '0' so we don't process them again.\n\nLet me think about possible edge cases. What if the grid is empty? Then return 0. If the grid has only one cell which is '1', then count is 1. Also, what about grids that are all '0's or all '1's.\n\nI should also consider the size of the grid. The constraints aren't given here, but for Java, it's important to handle large grids efficiently. Using DFS with recursion might cause stack overflow if the islands are too big. So maybe BFS is better? Or perhaps use iterative DFS instead of recursive to avoid stack issues.\n\nBut for simplicity and given that LeetCode usually expects a solution without worrying about such optimizations unless specified, I'll proceed with recursive DFS.\n\nSo let's outline the steps in code:\n\n- Read the grid dimensions: rows and columns.\n- Initialize count to 0.\n- Loop over each row i from 0 to rows-1:\n   - For each column j from 0 to cols-1:\n      - If grid[i][j] is '1', then do DFS on this cell and mark all connected '1's as visited, also increment count by 1.\n\nImplementing the DFS function:\n\nDFS will take i and j as parameters. Before doing anything, check if i and j are within bounds. Then, set grid[i][j] to '0' so we don't process it again. Then recursively call DFS on all four directions: up (i-1,j), down(i+1,j), left(i,j-1), right(i,j+1).\n\nWait, but when I change the cell to '0', that modifies the original grid which is fine since we're done with it.\n\nLet me think about how this will work. For each new '1' found, we trigger a DFS which marks all connected land as visited by turning them into '0's. So the next time they are encountered in the loop, they won't be processed again.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nNow, let's consider implementing this in Java.\n\nThe code structure would look like this:\n\npublic class Solution {\n    public int numIslands(char[][] grid) {\n        if (grid == null || grid.length == 0) return 0;\n        \n        int rows = grid.length;\n        int cols = grid[0].length;\n        int count = 0;\n        \n        for(int i=0; i<rows; i++){\n            for(int j=0; j<cols; j++){\n                if(grid[i][j] == '1'){\n                    dfs(grid, i, j);\n                    count++;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return count;\n    }\n    \n    private void dfs(char[][] grid, int i, int j){\n        // Check boundaries\n        if(i <0 || i >= grid.length || j<0 || j>=grid[0].length) return;\n        \n        if(grid[i][j] != '1') return; // already visited or water\n        \n        grid[i][j] = '0'; // mark as visited\n        \n        // Explore all four directions\n        dfs(grid, i-1, j); // up\n        dfs(grid, i+1, j); // down\n        dfs(grid, i, j-1); // left\n        dfs(grid, i, j+1); // right\n    }\n}\n\nWait a minute, I think the initial code is correct. Let's test it with an example.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n[\n  [\"1\",\"1\",\"0\"],\n  [\"1\",\"0\",\"1\"],\n  [\"0\",\"1\",\"1\"]\n]\n\nThis should have two islands.\n\nLet me see how the code processes this grid.\n\nFirst, i=0, j=0: '1' is found. So count becomes 1. Then DFS is called.\n\nIn DFS:\n- Set grid[0][0] to '0'\n- Check up (i-1=-1): return\n- Down (i+1=1, j=0)\n   - In DFS at (1,0):\n      - grid was '1' so set to '0'.\n      - check up (0,0) which is now '0', returns.\n      - down: i=2,j=0 which is '0'? Wait the original input's row 2 is \"0\",\"1\",\"1\". So at j=0, grid[2][0] is '0'. So in this case, after processing (1,0), it will explore all directions. For up, already processed; down to i=2 which is '0', so nothing. Left would be j=-1 for (1,-1) invalid. Right is j=1.\n\nWait no: the initial grid at (1,0) is '1'. So when we call DFS on (1,0), it changes that cell to '0' and then explores all four directions.\n\nSo in (1,0)'s right direction, j+1=1. grid[1][1] was originally '0', so nothing happens there.\n\nBack to the initial (0,0) call: after down, left is j-1=-1 invalid, right is j+1=1: which was '1'.\n\nWait no, in the original input, row 0's cells are [1,1,0]. So at j=1, grid[0][1] is '1'. So when we call dfs(0,1) from (0,0), it will process that.\n\nSo for (0,1):\n\nSet to '0', then explore four directions. Up: i-1=-1 invalid. Down: i+1=1, j=1 which was originally '0'—so nothing. Left is j-1=0, already processed. Right is j+1=2, which in row 0 is '0'.\n\nSo after that, the DFS for (0,0) has marked all connected '1's.\n\nWait no: perhaps I'm missing something. Because the initial grid may have islands connected across rows and columns.\n\nIn any case, this code should correctly mark all connected '1's as visited when processing each cell.\n\nAnother example:\n\nInput:\n[\n  [\"1\",\"0\"],\n  [\"0\",\"1\"]\n]\n\nThis has two separate islands. So count should be 2.\n\nThe code would process (0,0), find it's a '1', increment to 1, and DFS marks all connected '1's—but only that cell since its neighbors are 0s.\n\nThen at i=1, j=1: it's '1', so count becomes 2, and mark that cell as visited. So the code would correctly return 2.\n\nWhat about a grid with one row and multiple '1's?\n\nE.g., [\"1\",\"1\",\"0\",\"1\"]\n\nThis should be two islands. Let's see:\n\ni=0, j=0: '1' → count becomes 1. DFS marks (0,0) as '0', then checks up/down which are invalid. Left is -1, right is j+1=1.\n\nAt j=1: grid[0][1] was '1' so now it's processed. So this connects to the first cell, so the entire row from 0-2 (since at j=2 it's '0') but no, wait:\n\nWait after processing (0,0), which is '1', we change it to '0', and then call DFS on up, down, left, right.\n\nRight is j+1: grid[0][1] was '1' so that's processed as part of the same island. So in this case, cells 0 and 1 are connected, but cell 3 (j=3) is a separate '1'.\n\nSo when i=0, j=2 is '0', skip. Then j=3: grid[0][3] is '1' → count becomes 2.\n\nThus the code would correctly identify two islands in that case.\n\nSeems solid. So I think this implementation should handle all cases correctly.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct islands in a given grid where each cell can either be land ('1') or water ('0'). An island is defined as a group of adjacent '1's connected horizontally or vertically.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves using Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore each island starting from any unvisited '1' cell. Here are the steps:\n\n1. **Iterate through each cell** in the grid.\n2. When encountering an unvisited '1', increment the count of islands and initiate a DFS from that cell.\n3. In the DFS, mark the current cell as visited by changing it to '0' and recursively explore all four possible directions (up, down, left, right).\n4. Continue this process until all cells have been checked.\n\nThis ensures that each island is counted exactly once, and we efficiently traverse each cell only once, leading to an optimal solution.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef numIslands(grid):\n    if not grid:\n        return 0\n    count = 0\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0])\n    \n    def dfs(i, j):\n        if i < 0 or i >= rows or j < 0 or j >= cols or grid[i][j] != '1':\n            return\n        grid[i][j] = '0'  # Mark as visited\n        dfs(i-1, j)  # Up\n        dfs(i+1, j)  # Down\n        dfs(i, j-1)  # Left\n        dfs(i, j+1)  # Right\n    \n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            if grid[i][j] == '1':\n                count += 1\n                dfs(i, j)\n    \n    return count\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: We start by checking if the grid is empty. If it is, we return 0 as there are no islands.\n- **DFS Function**: This function marks a cell as visited (by setting it to '0') and recursively explores all four possible directions (up, down, left, right) to find all connected land cells.\n- **Grid Traversal**: We traverse each cell in the grid. If a cell is found to be '1', we increment the island count and initiate DFS from that cell to mark all connected '1's as visited.\n\nThis approach ensures that each island is counted exactly once, providing an efficient solution with a time complexity of O(n*m), where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns in the grid."

    "content": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to solve this problem called \"Number of Islands\" from LeetCode. The task is to determine how many distinct islands are present in a given grid where each cell can either be land ('1') or water ('0'). An island is defined as groups of '1's connected horizontally or vertically.\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand the problem deeply. So, an island is formed when adjacent '1's are connected. For example, if there's a cluster of '1's next to each other either up, down, left, or right, that's considered one island. My goal is to count all such distinct clusters in the grid.\n\nNow, thinking about how to approach this problem. One common method for exploring connected components in a grid is using Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS). Since I'm more comfortable with DFS, I'll go with that.\n\nSo, here's the rough plan:\n\n1. **Iterate through each cell** of the grid.\n2. When I encounter a '1', it means I've found the start of a new island. So, I increment my count of islands by 1.\n3. Then, from that starting point, I'll explore all connected '1's using DFS to mark them as visited so they aren't counted again.\n4. After processing the entire grid this way, I should have the total number of distinct islands.\n\nBut wait, how do I handle marking cells as visited? Since modifying the input might not be allowed in some cases, but for the sake of efficiency, it's better to mark them as visited directly by changing their value or using a separate visited matrix. In this case, since we're given that the grid can be modified (as it's part of the solution), I'll modify the '1's to '0's once they've been processed.\n\nSo, for each cell that is '1', I start DFS and change all connected '1's to '0's. This way, I ensure they aren't revisited or counted again.\n\nLet me outline the steps in code:\n\n- Check if the grid is empty; if so, return 0.\n- Initialize a counter to zero.\n- Loop over each row and column of the grid.\n- If a cell contains '1', increment the counter and call DFS on that cell.\n- In DFS:\n  - Mark the current cell as visited (change to '0').\n  - Recursively visit all four possible directions (up, down, left, right), checking if they are within bounds and contain '1'.\n  \nThat makes sense. Now, I need to translate this logic into Java.\n\nWait, in Java, handling a grid of characters can be done with a char array or as a String array. Since modifying the grid is part of our solution, it's easier to work with a char[][] array because Strings are immutable in Java.\n\nSo, first, I'll convert the input grid into a char array if it isn't already. But looking at the problem statement, the input is given as a list of strings, so I need to process each string into a character array for easy modification.\n\nBut perhaps for simplicity, since we're allowed to modify the grid in place, treating it as a 2D character array makes sense.\n\nOkay, now about writing the DFS function. It should be a helper method that takes the current row and column indices and modifies the grid accordingly.\n\nAlso, I need to handle the boundaries correctly. Before making any recursive calls, I should check if the new row or column is within the valid range of the grid dimensions to prevent IndexOutOfBoundsExceptions.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n1. Check if the input grid is empty or has zero rows; return 0 in that case.\n2. Initialize island count to 0.\n3. Get the number of rows and columns from the grid.\n4. Loop through each cell:\n   a. If cell is '1', increment count and call DFS on it.\n5. In DFS:\n   a. Check if current row and column are within bounds and cell is '1'.\n   b. Mark the cell as '0' to indicate visited.\n   c. Recursively visit all four directions.\n\nYes, that seems solid. Now, I need to think about possible edge cases:\n\n- Grid with all '0's: Should return 0.\n- Grid with a single '1': Should return 1.\n- Grid with multiple disconnected '1's.\n- Different configurations of islands to ensure the DFS correctly explores all connected cells.\n\nTesting is crucial here. Once I write the code, I'll need to test it against various scenarios to make sure it handles them all correctly.\n\nOne thing to note: Modifying the grid might not be acceptable in some coding platforms or if the function is supposed to preserve the input data. However, for this problem and given that it's a LeetCode challenge, modifying the grid is standard practice to optimize space usage since we don't need to track visited cells separately.\n\nAlright, time to put this into code.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the \"Number of Islands\" problem from LeetCode using Java, we will use Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore and count each distinct island in a given grid. An island is defined as groups of '1's connected horizontally or vertically.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Grid Traversal**: Iterate through each cell of the grid.\n2. **Island Detection**: When encountering a '1', it indicates the start of a new island. Increment the island count and initiate DFS from that cell.\n3. **DFS Exploration**: From the starting cell, recursively explore all four possible directions (up, down, left, right). Mark each visited cell as '0' to avoid revisiting and recounting.\n4. **Boundary Checks**: Ensure that during DFS traversal, we do not go out of grid bounds.\n\n### Solution Code\n```java\npublic class NumberOfIslands {\n    public int numIslands(char[][] grid) {\n        if (grid == null || grid.length == 0) {\n            return 0;\n        }\n        \n        int rows = grid.length;\n        int cols = grid[0].length;\n        int islandCount = 0;\n        \n        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {\n                if (grid[i][j] == '1') {\n                    islandCount++;\n                    dfs(grid, i, j);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        \n        return islandCount;\n    }\n    \n    private void dfs(char[][] grid, int i, int j) {\n        // Check boundaries\n        if (i < 0 || i >= grid.length || j < 0 || j >= grid[0].length || grid[i][j] != '1') {\n            return;\n        }\n        \n        // Mark as visited by setting to '0'\n        grid[i][j] = '0';\n        \n        // Explore all four directions\n        dfs(grid, i + 1, j); // down\n        dfs(grid, i - 1, j); // up\n        dfs(grid, i, j + 1); // right\n        dfs(grid, i, j - 1); // left\n    }\n    \n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        char[][] grid = {\n            {'1','1','0','0','0'},\n            {'1','1','0','0','0'},\n            {'0','0','1','0','0'},\n            {'0','0','0','1','1'}\n        };\n        \n        NumberOfIslands solution = new NumberOfIslands();\n        System.out.println(\"Number of islands: \" + solution.numIslands(grid));\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Grid Traversal**: The outer loops iterate through each cell in the grid. When a '1' is found, it signifies the start of a new island.\n- **DFS Exploration**: The `dfs` method marks the current cell as visited by setting it to '0'. It then recursively explores all four possible neighboring cells (up, down, left, right).\n- **Boundary Checks**: Before processing any cell in DFS, checks are made to ensure indices are within grid bounds and that the cell contains a '1'.\n- **Efficiency**: This approach efficiently counts each island by modifying the grid in place, thus avoiding additional space for tracking visited cells.\n\nThis solution effectively handles various edge cases, including grids with no islands, single-cell islands, and complex configurations of multiple islands."
