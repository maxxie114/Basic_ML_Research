        "content": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to solve LeetCode problem 200, which is about finding the number of islands in a binary grid. The grid consists of '1's representing land and '0's representing water. An island is formed by connecting adjacent lands either horizontally or vertically. The goal is to count how many such islands exist.\n\nFirst, I should understand the problem properly. Let me think about some examples. Suppose the grid is:\n\n[\n [1, 1, 0],\n [0, 1, 1],\n [0, 0, 0]\n]\n\nIn this case, there are two islands. The top-left 1 and connected to the right form one island, and then the middle has another cluster that's connected diagonally? Wait no, wait—no, because diagonal connections don't count here. So in this example, actually, it's only two islands as well.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of a simpler case. If the grid is all 0s except one cell with 1, then it's one island. If there are multiple disconnected clusters of 1s, each cluster is an island.\n\nSo the approach is to traverse the grid and every time we find a '1' that hasn't been visited yet, we start exploring all connected '1's (using either BFS or DFS) and mark them as visited. Each time we do this, we increment our island count by one.\n\nI think using DFS would be straightforward here. So let me outline the steps:\n\n1. Iterate through each cell in the grid.\n2. When a cell with value 1 is found, it's the start of a new island.\n3. Increment the count and then perform DFS to mark all connected '1's as visited (maybe by changing them to 0s or using a separate visited matrix).\n4. Continue until all cells are processed.\n\nI should decide whether to modify the grid itself to mark visited cells or use an additional structure like a boolean matrix. Modifying the grid might save space but could be considered bad practice if we're not supposed to change the input. However, since the problem allows it and it's efficient, I'll go with modifying the grid.\n\nSo during DFS, when visiting a cell (i,j), I will mark it as 0 so that it's not revisited again. Then, check all four possible directions (up, down, left, right) for neighboring '1's.\n\nNow, how do I implement this in Java? Let me outline the steps:\n\n- Read the grid dimensions m and n.\n- Initialize a count variable to 0.\n- Loop through each cell (i from 0 to m-1, j from 0 to n-1).\n   - If grid[i][j] is 1:\n      - Increment count.\n      - Perform DFS starting at (i,j), marking all connected '1's as 0.\n\nImplementing DFS:\n\nCreate a helper function that takes i and j. The function will:\n\n- Check if i and j are within bounds, grid[i][j] is 1.\n   If not, return.\n- Mark grid[i][j] as 0.\n- Recursively call the helper on all four possible directions.\n\nAlternatively, I could use a stack for iterative DFS or queue for BFS. For Java, using recursion might be straightforward but with potential stack overflow issues for large grids. But given that LeetCode constraints are manageable, perhaps it's acceptable.\n\nWait, but Java has a default stack size which might not handle very deep recursions. Maybe an iterative approach is safer. Let me think: for the purposes of this problem and typical test cases, recursion should be fine. But perhaps using BFS with queues would be more controlled in terms of stack depth.\n\nLet's proceed with DFS for now.\n\nNow, coding steps:\n\nIn Java:\n\npublic class Solution {\n    public int numIslands(char[][] grid) {\n        if (grid == null || grid.length == 0) return 0;\n        int m = grid.length;\n        int n = grid[0].length;\n        int count = 0;\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {\n                if (grid[i][j] == '1') {\n                    count++;\n                    dfs(grid, i, j);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n        return count;\n    }\n\n    private void dfs(char[][] grid, int i, int j) {\n        // Check boundaries and if it's land\n        if (i < 0 || j < 0 || i >= grid.length || j >= grid[0].length || grid[i][j] != '1') {\n            return;\n        }\n\n        // Mark as visited by changing to water\n        grid[i][j] = '0';\n\n        // Explore all four directions\n        dfs(grid, i+1, j);  // down\n        dfs(grid, i-1, j);  // up\n        dfs(grid, i, j+1);  // right\n        dfs(grid, i, j-1);  // left\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but the grid is a char array. I think in the problem statement, it's represented as integers, but perhaps in LeetCode, sometimes it's given as chars for some test cases.\n\nBut regardless, the logic remains the same: check if current cell is '1' or 1.\n\nWait, let me check the actual problem statement. The user provided links where it says \"binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water)\", so I think in Java, it might be an int[][] but sometimes can be char arrays depending on LeetCode's test cases.\n\nSo perhaps better to handle both possibilities? Or ensure that the code is written accordingly. Since the user is asking for a solution, perhaps assuming grid is an int[][] would be correct.\n\nWait, looking at the sample provided in the problem statement, it shows \"1\"s and \"0\"s as strings, but in Java, probably as integers.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes grids are represented with '1' and '0' as characters. So to make the code more flexible, perhaps checking for both cases.\n\nBut let's proceed with char grid as per the sample links, like this GitHub solution I found earlier.\n\nWait, looking at the first link in the tools response: \n\n{\"title\":\"200. Number of Islands - LeetCode\",\"link\":\"//duckduckgo.com/l/?uddg=https%3A%2F%2Fleetcode.com%2Fproblems%2Fnumber%2Dof%2Dislands%2Fsolutions%2D3220533%2F200-solution-with-step-by-step-explanation/...}\n\nBut perhaps the specific code isn't accessible. So, to proceed with writing Java code.\n\nNow, let me think about edge cases:\n\n- Empty grid: return 0.\n- All water: return 0.\n- All land: count as one island.\n- Single cell: if '1', then 1; else 0.\n\nAnother approach is to use BFS instead of DFS. It might be better for avoiding stack overflows in certain scenarios, but as mentioned earlier, recursion depth can be a problem with very large grids, which may not be the case here.\n\nSo, considering both approaches:\n\nUsing BFS:\n\nIn the helper function, we would have a queue that holds the cells to process. For each '1' encountered, add it to the queue and mark as visited (by changing to '0'). Then while the queue is not empty, dequeue a cell and check its four neighbors; if any neighbor is '1', enqueue it and mark as 0.\n\nBut for code brevity, perhaps DFS using recursion is easier.\n\nNow, implementing in Java:\n\nWait, but Java passes arrays by reference, so modifying grid within the dfs function will affect the original grid. That's acceptable because we're marking visited cells, thus preventing revisiting them.\n\nTesting this approach with sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 1:\n[\n [1,1,0],\n [0,1,1],\n [0,0,0]\n]\n\nThe code should find two islands. Let me see how it would process.\n\nFirst cell (0,0) is '1', count becomes 1. Then DFS marks all connected '1's as '0'. So after this step, the grid has:\n\n[\n [0,0,0],\n [0,1,1],\n [0,0,0]\n]\n\nWait no—because in the first step, (0,0) is processed, then it looks down to (1,0), which is 0. Then right to (0,1), which is '1', so dfs there.\n\nIn (0,1), it will mark as '0' and check all neighbors. It can go down to (1,1) which is '1', process that, then from (1,1) go right to (1,2), etc.\n\nSo after this initial call, the first island (top-left 2x2 except bottom-right?) Wait no, maybe it's a single island because connected via edges.\n\nWait in the sample input I provided earlier:\n\nOriginal grid:\n1 1 0\n0 1 1\n0 0 0\n\nThe code should find two islands. But according to the processing, after first cell (0,0) is processed, all connected '1's are marked as 0, which would include (0,1), (1,1), and (1,2). So the grid becomes:\n\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n\nWait no—that can't be right because in that case, count is only 1. But according to my initial example, perhaps I was wrong in the setup.\n\nWait, actually, let's think: In the first grid, (0,0) is '1', so we process it and all connected '1's which are (0,1), (1,1), and (1,2). So after that, those cells are marked as 0. Then when i=0, j=2 is processed, but it's 0. Moving on.\n\nThen in the next rows:\n\ni=1: all are now 0 except if any 1s remain? Wait no—because after processing (0,0), all connected '1's including (1,1) and (1,2) would have been marked as 0.\n\nThus, the grid after processing first cell is all 0s. So count remains at 1. But that contradicts my initial thought of having two islands.\n\nAh! Wait, maybe I set up a wrong example. Let me correct it:\n\nAnother sample input:\n\n[\n [1,1,0],\n [0,0,1],\n [0,1,1]\n]\n\nIn this case, the first island is (0,0), (0,1). Then another cell at (2,2) which connects to (2,1) and (1,2). So total islands: 2.\n\nBut perhaps it's better not to get stuck on examples. Let me proceed with writing code and see.\n\nNow, coding:\n\nIn Java, the grid is a char[][], but sometimes could be int[][]; however, in LeetCode, the function signature for this problem expects a char[][] as input.\n\nWait, checking the initial user message: the user provided some tools' responses which included various solutions. For example, one of them was a YouTube link with Java solution. Let me check that video's code (if I can recall).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to write the code assuming it's an int[][] grid. But in the LeetCode problem statement, the parameters are:\n\npublic int numIslands(char[][] grid)\n\nSo yes, it's a char grid.\n\nTherefore, I'll proceed with the code as follows.\n\nWait, but for Java, passing a 2D array, each cell is a char—so '0' and '1'.\n\nThus, in the helper function, checking if grid[i][j] == '1'.\n\nNow, putting it all together:\n\nThe main function loops through each cell. When it finds a '1', increments count, then calls dfs to mark all connected as visited.\n\nPotential issues: modifying the input grid. Is that allowed? Well, in programming contests and LeetCode, it's acceptable because we are not required to preserve the input.\n\nThus, this approach should work.\n\nNow, considering time complexity: O(m*n) since each cell is processed once. Space complexity is O(m*n) for the recursive stack in worst case (like a grid with all '1's), leading to stack overflow. But as LeetCode has constraints that are manageable, perhaps it's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, using iterative DFS or BFS would avoid this issue.\n\nBut for now, let me proceed with the recursive approach.\n\nThus, the code is written as:\n\npublic class Solution {\n    public int numIslands(char[][] grid) {\n        if (grid == null || grid.length == 0) return 0;\n        int rows = grid.length;\n        int cols = grid[0].length;\n        int count = 0;\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {\n                if (grid[i][j] == '1') {\n                    count++;\n                    dfs(grid, i, j);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n        return count;\n    }\n\n    private void dfs(char[][] grid, int i, int j) {\n        // Check boundaries and whether it's land\n        if (i < 0 || j < 0 || i >= grid.length || j >= grid[0].length || grid[i][j] != '1') {\n            return;\n        }\n\n        // Mark as visited by changing to water\n        grid[i][j] = '0';\n\n        // Explore all four directions: up, down, left, right\n        dfs(grid, i-1, j);  // Up\n        dfs(grid, i+1, j);  // Down\n        dfs(grid, i, j-1);  // Left\n        dfs(grid, i, j+1);  // Right\n    }\n}\n\nI think this should work. Now, to test with a sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n[\n [\"1\",\"1\",\"0\"],\n [\"0\",\"1\",\"1\"],\n [\"0\",\"0\",\"0\"]\n]\n\nExpected Output: 1\n\nWait, wait no—actually, in this grid, the '1's are connected. So it should be one island.\n\nAnother Test Case:\n\nGrid:\n[\"1\", \"0\", \"1\"],\n[\"1\", \"0\", \"1\"],\n[\"0\", \"1\", \"1\"]\n\nThis forms two separate islands: one at top-left and bottom-right.\n\nWait no—actually, they might form a single island because diagonally adjacent are not connected. Wait, in the problem statement, it's only horizontal and vertical connections that matter. So if cells are connected via those directions, it counts as an island.\n\nSo for the grid:\n\n1 0 1\n\n1 0 1\n\n0 1 1\n\nThe top-left cell (0,0) connects down to (1,0), which is 1. Then (1,0) can connect right to (1,1) but it's 0. So the island includes (0,0) and (1,0). The cell (0,2) is '1', but not connected to others except if there's a path.\n\nWait no—cell (0,2) is only connected to itself unless connected via other cells.\n\nIn this grid:\n\nRow 0: [1,0,1]\n\nRow 1: [1,0,1]\n\nRow 2: [0,1,1]\n\nSo cell (0,0) connects down to row 1, column 0. But beyond that, no connections to other '1's except those in the same column.\n\nCell (1,0) is connected to (0,0), but nothing else around it except possibly (2,0) which is 0.\n\nSo the two islands would be:\n\nIsland 1: (0,0) and (1,0).\n\nIsland 2: (0,2), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2).\n\nWait no—because cell (1,2) is '1', connected to (0,2). Cell (2,2) is '1' connected to (1,2). Then, cell (2,1) is connected to (2,2). So these form a single island.\n\nThus, total islands: 2.\n\nSo the code should return 2 for this grid.\n\nAnother Test Case:\n\nGrid:\n[\"0\",\"0\",\"0\"],\n[\"0\",\"0\",\"0\"]\n\nOutput: 0.\n\nEdge Cases:\n\n- All '1's: returns 1.\n\n- Single cell with '1': returns 1.\n\nNow, think about implementing in Java. The code should handle these cases.\n\nI think this approach is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem of counting the number of islands in a binary grid using Java, we can utilize a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm. This approach efficiently traverses each cell of the grid and marks visited cells to avoid revisiting them, thus allowing us to count each unique island once.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires counting the number of islands in a 2D binary grid where '1's represent land and '0's represent water. An island is defined as a group of connected '1's horizontally or vertically.\n2. **Intuition**: Each time we encounter an unvisited '1', it signifies the start of a new island. We can use DFS to explore all connected '1's starting from this cell, marking them as visited by changing their value to '0'.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: DFS is chosen due to its simplicity and effectiveness in exploring all nodes reachable from a given starting node.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The time complexity is O(m * n) where m and n are the dimensions of the grid, as each cell is processed exactly once. The space complexity is also O(m * n) in the worst case due to the recursion stack used by DFS.\n\n### Solution Code\n```java\npublic class Solution {\n    public int numIslands(char[][] grid) {\n        if (grid == null || grid.length == 0) return 0;\n        int rows = grid.length;\n        int cols = grid[0].length;\n        int count = 0;\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {\n                if (grid[i][j] == '1') {\n                    count++;\n                    dfs(grid, i, j);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n        return count;\n    }\n\n    private void dfs(char[][] grid, int i, int j) {\n        // Check boundaries and whether it's land\n        if (i < 0 || j < 0 || i >= grid.length || j >= grid[0].length || grid[i][j] != '1') {\n            return;\n        }\n\n        // Mark as visited by changing to water\n        grid[i][j] = '0';\n\n        // Explore all four directions: up, down, left, right\n        dfs(grid, i - 1, j);   // Up\n        dfs(grid, i + 1, j);   // Down\n        dfs(grid, i, j - 1);   // Left\n        dfs(grid, i, j + 1);   // Right\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: The main function `numIslands` initializes the count of islands and iterates through each cell in the grid.\n- **DFS Trigger**: Whenever an unvisited '1' is encountered, it triggers a DFS to mark all connected '1's as visited by changing them to '0'. Each trigger increments the island count.\n- **DFS Helper Function**: This function checks boundaries and whether the current cell is land ('1'). If valid, it marks the cell as visited and recursively processes its four neighboring cells (up, down, left, right).\n\nThis approach ensures that each cell is processed only once, leading to an efficient solution for counting islands in the grid."
